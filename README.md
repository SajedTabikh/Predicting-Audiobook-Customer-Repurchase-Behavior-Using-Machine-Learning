# Predicting Audiobook Customer Repurchase Behavior Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict whether customers of an audiobook company will make repeat purchases. The dataset, which includes features such as book length, price paid, review scores, total minutes listened, and other customer behaviors, was preprocessed to balance the classes and split into training, validation, and test sets. Using TensorFlow, I built a neural network model that achieved high performance metrics.

## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to predict customer repurchase behavior for an audiobook company. By understanding and predicting these behaviors, the company can target its advertising efforts more effectively, optimizing marketing expenditures and fostering customer retention.

## Data Collection

The dataset includes various features such as:

- Book length
- Price paid
- Review scores
- Total minutes listened
- Other customer behaviors

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Balancing the classes
- Normalizing numerical features
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets

## Model Building

Using TensorFlow, a neural network model was developed with the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Preparing the data for training
3. Building the neural network architecture
4. Training the model on the training data
5. Evaluating the model on the validation data
6. Fine-tuning the model

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Precision: 0.88
- Recall: 0.77
- F1 Score: 0.82
- AUC-ROC: 0.92

These metrics demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict customer repurchase behavior.

## Results

The neural network model successfully identifies customers who are likely to make repeat purchases. This enables the audiobook company to target its marketing efforts more effectively, optimizing advertising expenditures and improving customer retention.
